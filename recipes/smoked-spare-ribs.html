        <h2><strong>Smoked Pork Spare Ribs</strong></h2>
            <p>This fantastic recipe for smoked pork spare ribs can be used with either St-Louis style spare ribs or baby back ribs. You can choose your favorite pork rub, as well as choice of wood for smoking. I prefer fruit woods, such as apple or cherry. However, Pecan or oak are also great choices as well. Serve them with some great southern sides like potato salad or baked beans</p>
        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>rack of spare ribs</li>
                <li>4 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
                <li>rib rub</li>
                <li>1/2 cup apple juice</li>
                <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            </ul>
        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the smoker to 225 degree F</li>
                <li>Trim the membrane and excess fat off the ribs</li>
                <li>Rub a thin coat of mustard onto the ribs and generously sprinkle the rub on both sides of the ribs</li>
                <li>Place the ribs on the smoker bone-side down</li>
                <li>Combine in a spray bottle the apple juice, apple cider vinegar, and water. Spritz the ribs after one hour and every hour there after until they are taken off the smoker</li>
                <li>Continue smoking the ribs until the meat pulls back approximately 1/4in off the bone and a crispy bark has formed, about 5-6 hours</li>
                <li>Remove from the smoker and allow to rest tented in aluminum foil for 15 minutes</li>
            </ol>
